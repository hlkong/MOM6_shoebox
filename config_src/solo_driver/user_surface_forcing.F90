!! \namespace user_surface_forcing
!!
!! This file contains the subroutines that a user should modify to
!! to set the surface wind stresses and fluxes of buoyancy or
!! temperature and fresh water.  They are called when the run-time
!! parameters WIND_CONFIG or BUOY_CONFIG are set to "USER".  The
!! standard version has simple examples, along with run-time error
!! messages that will cause the model to abort if this code has no
!! been modified.  This code is intended for use with relatively
!! simple specifications of the forcing.  For more complicated forms,
!! it is probably a good idea to read the forcing from input files
!! using "file" for WIND_CONFIG and BUOY_CONFIG.
!!
!! USER_wind_forcing() should set the surface wind stresses (taux and
!! tauy) perhaps along with the surface friction velocity (ustar).
!!
!! USER_buoyancy() forcing is used to set the surface buoyancy
!! forcing, which may include a number of fresh water flux fields
!! (evap, lprec, fprec, lrunoff, frunoff, and
!! vprec) and the surface heat fluxes (sw, lw, latent and sens)
!! if temperature and salinity are state variables, or it may simply
!! be the buoyancy flux if it is not.  This routine also has coded a
!! restoring to surface values of temperature and salinity.
