!!  By Robert Hallberg, May 2006.
!!
!!    This file contains the subroutine (write_cputime) that writes
!!  the summed CPU time across all processors to an output file. In
!!  addition, write_cputime estimates how many more time steps can be
!!  taken before 95% of the available CPU time is used, so that the
!!  model can be checkpointed at that time.
